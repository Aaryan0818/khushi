                        My name is Aaryan Shah. I was born on August 31, 2005 AD, which corresponds to May 15, 2062 BS. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science (Honors) degree in Computer Science at The British College, Thapathali. My aspiration is to become a proficient web designer.<br>

                        My educational journey began at Rosebud School located in Buddhanagar, Kathmandu, where I successfully completed my SEE exam. I then pursued my higher secondary education at Uniglobe College situated in Kamaladi, Kathmandu. Throughout my childhood, I was captivated by various websites and often pondered over how they were created and operated. Over the years, my curiosity led me to discover the intricate workings of website development. With this newfound knowledge, I am determined to delve deeper into the field and excel as a web developer.<br>
                        
                        I firmly believe that the future lies in Information Technology, and I am eager to contribute to its evolution.</P><br>
